# SecAuthUAV
In this repository there is a study of the SecAuthUAV [^fn3] protocol, a mutual authentication protocol for UAVs, proposed by Alladi, Naren, Bansal, Chamola and Guizani. 

This study was done as a Computer Network Security seminar. 

## Future works
In the future, formal security verification of the protocol, done using the most common formal verification tools, will be published.
