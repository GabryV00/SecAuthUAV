# SecAuthUAV - An Authentication protocol for UAVs
In this repository there is a study of the SecAuthUAV [^fn3] protocol, a mutual authentication protocol for UAVs, proposed by Alladi, Naren, Bansal, Chamola and Guizani. 

This study was done as a Computer Network Security seminar. The purpose of this work was to analyze the authentication protocols for the IoD (Internet of Drones) field proposed in the literature and investigate the best one.

Furthermore, in the presentation slides of the seminar, the security flaws discovered on DJI products [^fn1] are also mentioned.

## Future works
In the future, formal security verification of the protocol, done using the most common formal verification tools, will be published.
